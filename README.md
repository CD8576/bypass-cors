# üåê CORS Bypass Proxy - Simple and Fast Cross-Origin Requests üöÄ  

![build-test](https://github.com/mskian/bypass-cors/workflows/build-test/badge.svg)  

üåç Bypass CORS restrictions easily with a simple proxy. Make fast cross-origin requests for better API access without complications ‚ö°  

**Note**  

I primarily built this tool for personal use, and I mostly run it on my home server or localhost.This tool is not recommended for production use, as it lacks additional security layers such as header authentication, API keys, or token methods to prevent unauthorized access. However, you are welcome to fork the project and make any changes as needed.
